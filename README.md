# Database Design and Implementation for a Fitness Center

## Project Overview
The project involves designing and implementing the database component for a Fitness Center based on wireframe screens provided during the requirements analysis.

## Objective
Reinforce course concepts by engaging in the database design process, from business rules development to implementation.

## Group Work and Weightage
- The project is evaluated on group work, and specific points and weightage are assigned to each deliverable.

## Deliverables

### 1. Conceptual Model (ER Diagram)
- Developed using Visual Paradigm, Visio, Draw.IO, or equivalent software.
- Clearly outlines business entities, attributes, and relationships.
- Assumptions made during the process are stated in the EER diagram.

### 2. Relational Database
- Relational logical data model: Converted the conceptual model to a relational logical model.
- Ensured all tables are in the 3rd normal form.
- Developed SQL scripts for table creation and constraint enforcement.
- Included sample SQL scripts for inserting data into the database.

### 3. NoSQL Implementation (MongoDB)
- Converted at least 2 entities to MongoDB Collections.
- Provided scripts for creating the collection(s).

### 4. SQL SELECT Statements
- Created SQL SELECT statements for specific queries related to wireframe tabs.

## GitHub Repository Structure

### 1. `/Diagrams`
- Contains visual representations of the conceptual and relational models.

### 2. `/SQL_Scripts`
- Includes SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and SELECT statements.

### 3. `/NoSQL_Scripts`
- Contains MongoDB scripts for creating collections.

### 4. `/Reports`
- Final report in Microsoft Word format with a professionally formatted cover page.
- Each deliverable has a designated section with the name of the report, group members, and page numbers in the footer.

## Instructions

- Follow the guidelines for formatting and tool usage outlined in the instructions.
- Clearly present assumptions made during the design process.
- Collaborate effectively within the group to ensure each member's responsibilities are met.
- If any issues arise, communicate promptly and transparently within the group.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Database Setup
- Execute SQL scripts in `/SQL_Scripts` to create tables and insert sample data.
- Run MongoDB scripts in `/NoSQL_Scripts` to set up MongoDB collections.

### 2. Querying Data
- Utilize SQL SELECT statements provided in `/SQL_Scripts` to retrieve specific information.

## Note
Please refer to the wireframes provided at the end of the document for context on entities, attributes, and relationships.
